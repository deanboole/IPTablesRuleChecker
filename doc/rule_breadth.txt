To pin point to broad rules in scope, we are using scoring system in
which higher number means a narrower scope of a rule. So, after scoring
all the rules and sorting them in ascending order, you have rules ordered
from the most broad ones, to the most narrower ones.

For each selector some value is added. The trick is to define how much to
add. In the first iteration, the following values were added for each
rule (if they existed):

	-o			100
	-i			100
	-s			prefixlen
	-d			prefixlen
	-p			100
	-m tcp			100
		--dport		1000
		--sport		1000
	-m udp			100
		--dport		1000
		--sport		1000
	-m multiport		0 [ there is an error for ports defined as low:high]
		--sports	1000 / number_of_ports
		--dports	1000 / number_of_ports
	-m state		0
		--states	1000 / number_of_states
	-m icmp			100
		--icmp-type	100
	-m limit		1
	-m esp			100

This wasn't good because, e.g. rules with -i option were rated as better
than the ones with -s. So, the following requirement was introduced:

	When -s has 0 netmask, it has to be scored worse than -i. When the
	netmask grows, the scoring has to improve.

Next scoring system was:

	-o			100
	-i			100
	-s			prefixlen * 10
	-d			prefixlen * 10
	-p			100
	-m tcp			100
		--dport		1000
		--sport		1000
	-m udp			100
		--dport		1000
		--sport		1000
	-m multiport		0 [ there is an error for ports defined as low:high]
		--sports	1000 / number_of_ports
		--dports	1000 / number_of_ports
	-m state		0
		--states	1000 / number_of_states
	-m icmp			100
		--icmp-type	100
	-m limit		1
	-m esp			100

TODO:
	What about the order of rules? Is it important? How? And how much?

	Maybe to take into account trustwortheness of a network when scoring
	-i, -o, -s and -d?
